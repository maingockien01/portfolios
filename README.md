Feature Document: Multi-User Portfolio Web App with Custom Domain and Global Tenant Management
# Overview
This web application will enable multiple users to create and manage personal portfolios. Users can customize their portfolios with unique domains (either custom or subdomains), allowing each user to have their own web space for showcasing their work or projects. The app will also feature a global tenant management system, where users with admin permissions can manage other users (tenants), their roles, and portfolio access across the application.

# Key Features
## 1. User Portfolio Management
   
- Portfolio Creation: Users can create personalized portfolios using templates or custom designs.
- Customizable Pages: Each portfolio can have multiple pages (Home, Projects, About, etc.) that can be customized with a drag-and-drop editor.
- Custom Domain Support:
   - Users can link their own domains to their portfolios (e.g., www.johndoe.com).
   - If a custom domain is not provided, users can use a subdomain provided by the app (e.g., johndoe.webapp.com).
- Media Integration: Users can upload images, videos, and documents to showcase in their portfolios.
- SEO Optimization: Each portfolio will include basic SEO settings (meta tags, descriptions, and keywords) for improved search visibility.
- Social Sharing: Integrated social media sharing for individual projects or portfolio pages.
